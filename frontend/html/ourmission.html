                <p>
                    Where property law is streamlined and accessible to everyone. At Rentalyze, 
                    drafting rental contracts or writing letters to councils and landlords takes mere minutes, not days.
                    Legal disputes over tenancy agreements and rent are swiftly identified and resolved, ensuring fairness for all parties. 
                    Tenants enjoy the same quality of legal advice as large property management firms, leveling the playing field. 
                    Landlords focus on managing their properties while AI handles routine legal tasks with precision. 
                    This is the future we are creating, where property law is simplified and justice is accessible to all.

                <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                <p>Our mission is to empower tenants in Ireland by providing a simple and effective way to address 
                    rental issues through formal complaint letters generated by AI.
                    By allowing tenants to input their rental contract and key details, we help them create well-structured letters that 
                    facilitate conflict resolution before legal action becomes necessary. 
                    In a challenging rental market where landlords may lack incentive to resolve problems, our goal is to foster fair communication and support tenants' rights, 
                    contributing to a more just housing environment.

                <p>The Contract PDF is searched and analyzed by our highly specialised AI model, to look for
                    any relevant clauses in relation to the problems provided. It will then generate a letter or
                    a contract based on clauses found or any information the AI deems to be beneficial. It then creates
                    a PDF of the letter or contract to be downloaded and sent to the relevant entities.
