                <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
                <p>The Irish rental market faces a severe crisis. 
                Due to a lower supply of available rental properties on the market and increased competition among renters, landlords are no longer incentivised to address issues that may arise, leaving many landlord-tenant conflicts unresolved. 
                The Residential Tenancies Board is slow to act, limiting options for tenants.
                Furthermore, professional legal services are often inaccessible and expensive, leaving many tenants vulnerable and without effective support.

                <h2>OUR SOLUTION</h2>
                <p>"RentaLyze" empowers tenants to resolve disputes swiftly and affordably. 
                    Our AI-driven platform simplifies the process of drafting formal, clause-based complaint letters. 
                    By allowing tenants to upload their rental agreements, our AI identifies key clauses in their rental contract and generates tailored letters for conflict resolution, helping tenants communicate their concerns effectively before conflicts escalate to costly legal action. 
                    Our mission is to protect tenantsâ€™ rights, promote fair communication, and foster a more just and transparent housing environment.
